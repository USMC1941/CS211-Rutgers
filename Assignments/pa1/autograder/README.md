# pa1 Autograder (Introduction to C)

This is your `auto_grader` directory. This directory contains your
`auto_grader` to test your assignment.

There are two modes available for testing your assignment with the
`auto_grader`.

## First mode
--- 

Testing with a `pa1` folder

1. Lets say you have a `pa1` folder with the directory structure as described in the assignment.
2. Copy the folder to the directory of the autograder
3. Run the autograder with the following command
```sh
$ python auto_grader.py 
```

It will run your programs and print your scores.

## Second Mode
---

This mode is to test your final submission (i.e, `pa1.tar`)

1. Copy `pa1.tar` to the `auto_grader` directory
2. Run the auto_grader with `pa1.tar` as the argument.

The command line is 
```sh
$ python auto_grader.py pa1.tar
```

## FAQs
---
1. Your program should return `0` from `main` and every place you exit.
2. Your `pa1` folder and `pa1.tar` should have the correct directory structure.
3. You should not have extra print statements and new lines in your output.
4. You should not touch the `testcases` directory. If you create any
temporary file in the `testcases` directory, the autograder will not
work.
